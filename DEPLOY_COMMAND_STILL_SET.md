# ⚠️ Deploy Command is STILL SET!

Your logs show:
```
Executing user deploy command: npx wrangler deploy
```

This means the deploy command is NOT empty!

## Please do this:

1. Go to Cloudflare Pages Dashboard
2. Click your project 
3. Go to **Settings** → **Builds & deployments**
4. Find the **"Deploy command"** field
5. Click inside the field
6. Press **Ctrl+A** (or **Cmd+A** on Mac) to select ALL text
7. Press **Delete** key
8. The field should now be COMPLETELY EMPTY
9. Scroll down and click **"Save"**
10. Wait for the "Settings updated" confirmation
11. Go back to deployments and trigger a new build

## Make sure to:
- ✅ Actually DELETE all text in the deploy command field
- ✅ The field should be BLANK/EMPTY
- ✅ Click SAVE after clearing it
- ✅ Wait for confirmation that settings were saved

## The field might look empty but still have:
- Hidden spaces
- Line breaks
- Invisible characters

That's why you MUST:
1. Click in the field
2. Select ALL (Ctrl+A / Cmd+A)
3. Delete
4. Save

Try using a different browser if the settings aren't saving properly.
