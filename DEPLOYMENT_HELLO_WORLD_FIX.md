# üö® Fix "Hello World" Deployment Issue

## Problem
Your site shows "Hello World" instead of the actual application. This happens when Cloudflare Pages serves the wrong files.

## Root Cause
The build output directory is probably wrong in your Cloudflare Pages settings.

## Solution: Update Cloudflare Pages Settings

### Go to Cloudflare Pages Dashboard:
1. **Click your project**
2. **Settings** ‚Üí **Builds & deployments**
3. **Update these settings:**

```
Build command: pnpm run build
Build output directory: .next
Deploy command: true
Framework preset: Next.js
Node.js version: 18
```

### Critical: Build Output Directory
Make sure it's exactly:
- ‚úÖ `.next` (with the dot)
- ‚ùå NOT `out`
- ‚ùå NOT `dist` 
- ‚ùå NOT `build`

## Alternative: Check Environment Variables

Make sure these environment variables are set in Cloudflare Pages:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_POCKETBASE_URL=your_pocketbase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_LIFF_ID=your_liff_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME=your_bot_username
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

## Test Steps:
1. Update settings
2. Save changes
3. Trigger new deployment
4. Wait for build to complete
5. Check youngid.xyz

## Expected Result:
You should see the learning dashboard with:
- "Good morning, Alex! üåü"
- Stats cards
- Beautiful gradient design
- NOT "Hello World"

## If Still Showing "Hello World":
1. Clear browser cache completely
2. Try incognito/private browsing
3. Check if you're visiting the right domain
4. Verify deployment completed successfully
