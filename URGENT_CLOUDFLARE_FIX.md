# üö® URGENT: Cloudflare Pages Deploy Command Issue

## The Problem

Your Cloudflare Pages deployment is failing because it's running:
```
Executing user deploy command: npx wrangler deploy
```

This command is **WRONG** and needs to be removed.

## The Solution

### Go to Cloudflare Pages Dashboard NOW:

1. Open [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
2. Click on your project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Builds & deployments**
4. Find these fields and update them:

### ‚úÖ CORRECT Settings:
```
Build command: pnpm run build
Build output directory: .next
Deploy command: [LEAVE COMPLETELY EMPTY]
Framework preset: Next.js
Node.js version: 18
```

### ‚ùå WRONG Settings:
```
Deploy command: npx wrangler deploy    ‚Üê DELETE THIS!
Deploy command: wrangler deploy        ‚Üê DELETE THIS!
Deploy command: anything at all        ‚Üê DELETE THIS!
```

## How to Fix:

1. **Click on the Deploy command field**
2. **Select all text (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)**
3. **Press Delete**
4. **Make sure the field is COMPLETELY EMPTY**
5. **Save changes**
6. **Trigger a new deployment**

## Why This Happens:

- Wrangler is for Cloudflare **Workers** (serverless functions)
- You're using Cloudflare **Pages** (static sites + API routes)
- They are DIFFERENT products with DIFFERENT deployment methods
- Pages doesn't need a deploy command - it handles it automatically

## Verification:

After fixing, your build log should show:
```
Success: Build command completed
Publishing to Cloudflare Pages...  ‚Üê This should happen automatically
```

NOT:
```
Executing user deploy command: npx wrangler deploy  ‚Üê This is WRONG
```

## Still Not Working?

If you've cleared the deploy command and it's still running wrangler:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Try a different browser
3. Make sure you clicked "Save" after clearing the field
4. Check if there are multiple environment configurations

## The Code is Fine

Your code is ready and working. The ONLY issue is the Cloudflare Pages dashboard configuration.
