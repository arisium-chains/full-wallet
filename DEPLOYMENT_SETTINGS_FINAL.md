# âœ… Final Cloudflare Pages Settings

## Correct Configuration:

```
Build command: pnpm run build
Deploy command: true
Non-production branch deploy command: (empty)
Path: /
Build output directory: .next
Framework preset: Next.js
Node.js version: 18
```

## Key Changes Made:
- Path: Changed from `.next` to `/` (root directory)
- Build output directory: Set to `.next` (where Next.js builds to)
- Homepage: Updated to show "Welcome to ARIS Wallet! ðŸŒŸ"

## Expected Result:
After deployment, youngid.xyz should show:
- Beautiful learning dashboard
- "Welcome to ARIS Wallet! ðŸŒŸ" header
- Stats cards and progress tracking
- Modern gradient design

## This Should Work!
The configuration is now correct for Next.js on Cloudflare Pages.
